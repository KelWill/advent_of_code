"""
## bug list

- missed attack stage after refactoring code
- didn't have correct order for directions for reading order
- didn't change an 'elves' to 'creatures' after refactoring code
- had two loops and renamed outer loop variable in inner loop thinking it'd be safe
- summed location rather than hit points because wasn't iterating what I thought I was iterating
- was incorrectly early returning first found valid location rather than best possible location
- misread instructionsâ€”that goal was for elves to win, not for no dead elves
