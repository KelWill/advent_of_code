## 2023 day 13

- I had a hard time thinking about which rows should be equal. Switching to zipped ranges made things a lot easier for me to reason about

## 2023 day 12

- dynamic programming problems are hard! switching on the decision points (?) rather than on the groups made the difference


## 2023 day 7

- calculated wrong sort order and was messing around with negative numbers
- didn't read the instructions for how the sorting order had changed for part II

## 2023 day 5

- assumed would only ever have 2 mappings
- didn't correctly identify where infinite loop was coming from
- creating a function in python that references outside variable will get the most recent value for that variable
- bad data setup. used function rather than simpler data format
- didn't look at output data and tried to brute-force the problem
- didn't pair off numbers correctly. rather than doing range(0, len(arr), 2) with i and i + 1, I instead did range(0, len(arr) // 2)
